  This is the main application file for the React project.

  Libraries used in this project:

  1. **React Router** (`react-router-dom`):
     - Used for managing navigation and routing in the application, allowing us to create a single-page application with multiple views.

  2. **Axios**:
     - A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests. It simplifies the process of sending GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests to remote servers.

  3. **Styled Components**:
     - A library for writing CSS in JavaScript. It allows for styling components at the component level, enabling dynamic styling and theme support.

  4. **React Hook Form**:
     - A library for handling forms in React applications. It provides an easy way to manage form state and validation, reducing boilerplate code.

  5. **React Icons**:
     - A collection of popular icons that can be easily included in your React components. This helps in adding icons without needing to manage SVG files manually.

  6. **React Toastify**:
     - A library for adding toast notifications in your application. It allows us to display brief messages to the user, such as success or error alerts.

  7. **React Helmet**:
     - A library for managing the document head. It helps in setting meta tags, titles, and other head elements dynamically based on the page content.

  8. **Redux (or Zustand)** (optional):
     - State management libraries that help in managing the application's global state. Redux is widely used, while Zustand is a simpler alternative.

  9. **Framer Motion** (optional):
     - A library for creating animations and transitions in React applications. It allows for smooth animations and provides an easy API for managing them.

  10. **Formik** (optional):
      - An alternative library for handling forms and validation in React. It provides a simpler API and structure compared to React Hook Form.

  11. **React Query** (optional):
      - A library for managing server state, caching, and fetching data from APIs. It simplifies data-fetching logic and improves performance.

  This setup provides a robust foundation for building a modern web application with React, ensuring a great user experience and maintainable code.
